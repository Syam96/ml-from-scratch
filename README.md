Implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch without using Sklearn


Best to way to learn how algorithms work is by re-implementing them. There is much more things happening behind every **model.predit()**.
This is my attempt to re-implement as well as learn how these algorithms work in pure python code without using any libraries.
